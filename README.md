# Steel-Columns-Cyclic-Test-Data
This repository contains test data sets for two experimental programs on steel wide-flange columns tested under cyclic lateral drift combined with axial load. The data includes the moment-rotation hysteretic response at the column base as well as the history of the column axial shortening. Please refer to the publications below for details about the testing programs and the basis for the measured test parameters.
